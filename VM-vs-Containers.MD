DevOps: Virtual Machines vs Containers

DevOps: A Brief Introduction
DevOps is a collection of principles that stresses collaboration and communication between software development and IT operations teams in order to automate the software delivery process and increase product quality and speed.

Virtual machines can be an effective tool in a DevOps context because they provide better flexibility, scalability, and portability. Similarly, DevOps and containers are inextricably linked, and containerization has emerged as a common method for software development and delivery in DevOps environments.

Virtual Machines: What Are They?
A virtual machine (VM) is a software emulation of a physical computer that can run an operating system and applications just like a physical computer. A virtual machine is created by a hypervisor, which is software that creates and manages virtual machines on a host machine. Each virtual machine has its own virtual CPU, memory, storage, and network interface.

The benefits of virtual machines include:

Consolidation: Multiple virtual machines can run on a single physical server, allowing for better utilization of resources and cost savings.
Isolation: Each virtual machine is isolated from other virtual machines on the same physical server, providing better security and stability.
Portability: Virtual machines can be easily moved between physical servers or cloud providers, providing flexibility and agility.
Testing and development: Virtual machines are useful for testing and development, as they allow developers to create multiple environments with different configurations and test software in a controlled environment.
Legacy software support: Virtual machines can be used to run legacy applications that require specific operating systems or hardware configurations.
Virtual machines are commonly used in enterprise environments, data centres, and cloud computing. They can run a wide range of operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS, and are used for a variety of applications, including web hosting, database management, and application development and testing.

Containers: What, Why and How?
Containers are a lightweight and portable way to package and run applications in a consistent and reproducible environment. A container is a standard unit of software that contains all the necessary code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings required to run an application. Containers are built from images, which are essentially snapshots of a container at a specific point in time.

The main benefits of using containers include:

Portability: Containers can be easily moved between different environments, such as development, testing, and production, without the need for significant changes.
Consistency: Containers ensure that the same code, libraries, and dependencies are used across different environments, providing a consistent and reliable experience.
Efficiency: Containers are lightweight and fast to start, allowing for better resource utilization and quicker deployment times.
Isolation: Containers provide isolation between applications and ensure that each application runs in its own environment, providing better security and stability.
DevOps support: Containers are well-suited for use in DevOps environments, as they enable faster and more reliable deployments and support a range of automation tools.
Containers are commonly used in cloud computing, where they can be easily deployed and scaled across multiple hosts. They are often used in conjunction with container orchestration tools such as Kubernetes or Docker Swarm, which can automate the deployment and management of containers across a cluster of hosts. Containers can also be used in traditional IT environments to improve application portability, consistency, and efficiency.

Virtual Machines vs Containers: How to Decide What is Better For You?
Virtual machines (VMs) and containers are both technologies used to create isolated environments for running applications, but they differ in several key ways:

Architecture: A VM emulates a complete hardware stack, including a virtualized CPU, memory, storage, and network interface, and runs a complete operating system, while a container shares the host machine’s kernel and runs only the necessary application binaries and libraries.
Resource Requirements: A VM typically requires more resources than a container, as it needs to allocate resources to run a complete operating system, whereas a container shares the host machine’s kernel and can run multiple containers with less overhead.
Isolation: A VM provides strong isolation between different applications, as each VM has its own operating system, while a container shares the host machine’s kernel and provides a more lightweight form of isolation.
Portability: Both VMs and containers can be easily moved between different environments, but containers typically provide better portability, as they are lighter weight and require fewer dependencies.
Management: VMs are managed as complete, stand-alone systems, while containers are managed as a group of running processes on the host operating system.
Overall, VMs are best suited for running legacy applications or operating systems that require complete isolation, while containers are better suited for running modern, cloud-native applications that can take advantage of the lightweight, portable, and scalable nature of containerization.

However, many organizations use both technologies together to take advantage of the benefits of both. For example, a VM might be used to run a database server, while multiple containers are used to run the front-end web servers that access the database.
